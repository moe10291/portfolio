                <p>Hello, My name is Mohammad Saleem. I'm a full-stack developer based in Newark, NJ. I'm always looking for an opportunity to to code, design and learn new things. I went to college for Accounting and before becoming a developer I worked as Accounts Payable/Receivable in a Property Management Company. I learned about effective communication, planning and paying attention to details. In my spare time I enjoy photography, listening to music, watching documentaries. I also love traveling and taking road-trips.

                    <h1>Restaurant Design</h1>
                    <p>Web design for a Restaurant Website using Javascript, HTML, CSS. Hover over "Most Wanted" Menu list  to experience CSS effects. It's a webpage with user-friendly with modern looks. It links to Facebook page, Twitter and Instagram. I plan on adding maps at the bottom of the page in-order to show exact location.   </p>

                    <h1>Shopping Cart</h1>
                    <p>This is a shopping cart made out of vanilla JS. User can add a product to the cart and remove individual product. As the products are being added the total dollar amount keeps adding up and if a product is deleted from the cart, the dollar amount goes down. Also, if a user refreshes the page, the products that they have added in the cart remains there. It's mobile friendly. Some Bootstrap was used to design the page </p>
